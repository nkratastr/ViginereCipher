# ViginereCipher

ViginereChiper is the second basic substitional chipering algorithm. This Project aims to teach and simulate the principles of viginerechiper. It has a chipering and
dechpiring module. It also has a module to cyrptoanalyse the given chipertext named Kasiski Analyse. It depends on a method that measures the distance between the same triaghprahps 
and try to calculete the lengh of secret key. 

Furhter Things to do
- Index of Coincidence Analyse Module (To estimate the secretkey lenght)
- Estimation after determining secretkey lenght
- Biagraph Analyse
